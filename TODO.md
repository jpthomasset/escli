# What would be awesome
- Natural language to query elastic (SQL like)
- Natural language to update/delete
- Autocomplete
- UI to query
- UI to present data


# Next steps
- Add test on CommandHandler
- Add Signal Handler to handle CTRL+C when issuing a query
- Add offset keyword
- Use external pager for output (as in mysql)
- handle IN clause with numbers
- display "\_" metadata with result (\_id, \_index, \_type, \_score)
- handle program argument cleanly
