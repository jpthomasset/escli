# What would be awesome
- Natural language to query elastic (SQL like)
- Natural language to update/delete
- Autocomplete
- UI to query
- UI to present data


# Next steps
- Refactor & Add test on ElasticJsonPrinter (column selection)
- Add test on CommandHandler
- Add Signal Handler to handle CTRL+C when issuing a query
- Query language:
  - Add keywords: offset, desc, show indices, not
  - Add != operator
  - handle IN clause with numbers
- Use external pager for output (as in mysql)
- handle program argument cleanly
