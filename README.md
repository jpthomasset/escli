escli
======

This program is a basic elastic search command line client. 

*This is a work in progress* : the program barely works and is more like an experiment at the moment. 

The goal is to have a cli that can run pseudo sql command against an elastic cluster.

Usage
-----
From the sbt command line, type 'run

```
%> sbt
> run
```
